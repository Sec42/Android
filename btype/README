 * Small program to generate keyboard input on android devices
 * Uses /dev/input/event* to simulate keypresses on the hardware keyboard
 * Tested and written on the HTC Vision a.k.a. Desire Z
 *
 * NOTE: Due to its design it can only create the characters you can
 * reach on your keyboard. Install a more capable keymap if you need
 * more characters.
