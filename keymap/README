This is my "enhanced" german Vision Z keymap. 

Here are all the changes from the stock CM keymap, and their rationale. If
someone has ideas how to improve it, please comment:

Fixed the following to match my printed keyboard labels:
alt+a => Euro     (+shift => Euro)
alt+b => sharp-s
alt+j => a umlaut (+shift => A umlaut)
alt+k => u umlaut (+shift => U umlaut)
alt+l => o umlaut (+shift => O umlaut)

alt+m => ' (was = before)
alt+? => = (was ' before)

Additionally added quite a few additional mappings for the "Shift+Alt"
layer which before was mostly unused:

Shift+Alt+C => [ (think Shift+( = [ )
Shift+Alt+V => ] (think Shift+) = ] )
Shift+Alt+Y => ~ (think Shift+_ = ~ )
Shift+Alt+X => ~ (Shift+- = ~ ) [dupe of previous key, I found both useful]
Shift+Alt+M => ` (think Shift+' = ` )
Shift+/     => \ 
Shift+Alt+/ => | (similar to / and \)
Shift+@     => ^ (the ^ key is usually on the top left in germany)
Alt+Enter   => ^m (The "other" kind of newline)
Shift+,     => ; (easy access, same as with Alt)
Shift+.     => : (easy access, same as with Alt)

and last but not least some keys which don't have a really good place, but
were needed anyway:

Shift+Alt+B => <
Shift+Alt+N => >  [the two keys to the right of ()]
Shift+,     => {
Shift+.     => }  [right and left of the space bar]

Also fixes the "numbers mode" mappings:

The first row now produces the numbers on the labels:

qwertzuiop => 1234567890

Also allowed the "numbers mode" to produce standard delimiters according
to the special chars printed on the keys:

C => (
H => *
N => +
S => #
V => )
X => -

All other alpha alpha keys were changed to produce the same number in the
keyboard row it is in (e.g. U=7, therefore J and M => 7, too).

With this modifications it should even be possible to play nethack on your
Desire Z :-)

To install:

adb push vision-keypad-ger.kcm.bin  /system/usr/keychars/

(You might need an "adb remount" beforehand)

Have Fun,

P.S.: The keymap is a binary / "compiled" file. The tools to work with
this format are "kcm" and "unkcm" which can be found at
